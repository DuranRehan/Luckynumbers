# üçÄ LuckyNumbers (Console-Based Java Version)

This is a **minimal console-based version** of the puzzle game **Lucky Numbers**, developed as part of my **first academic programming project**. It focuses on implementing the core game mechanics and rules using basic Java syntax and terminal interaction.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This was my very first programming project, created during the early stages of my learning journey. It does **not reflect my current skill level**, but remains available publicly as part of my growth as a developer.
